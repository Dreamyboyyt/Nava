Build an Android-only Flutter app named Nava — The Demon Lord’s Diary, themed around dark fantasy anime (inspired by Milim Nava), where users log tasks as conquests, track mood as glowing mana, write grimoire-style journals, and optionally evolve skill trees and magical companion pets. Use production-quality code with clean structure and dark-themed UI. Do not attach or manually write the CI workflow — it must be self-generated by the repo; also, do not include font suggestions, sample assets, or boilerplate comments. The final output must be a fully modular, high-performance Flutter app with immersive UI, proper state separation, Android adaptive icon at assets/adaptive-icon.png, and code output formatted per file using CLI-friendly editing instructions.

Warning: No flutter available in current environment.
